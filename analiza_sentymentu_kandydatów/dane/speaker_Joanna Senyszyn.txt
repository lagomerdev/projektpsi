Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, I will, of course, be a stateswoman, not a statesman, because feminatives are very important. I will oppose all laws that are passed solely in the interest of the parties, not society and Poland. First and foremost, Polish women and men have been persuaded that 5% of GDP must be spent on defense. These are enormous, almost unimaginable sums of money. It is already clear to the naked eye that there will be no war. The Russians have almost stopped occupying new territories in Ukraine. There will be peace talks soon. These 90 billion zlotys, between 3.5% and 5%, can be allocated to healthcare and construction. Unlike my predecessors, I will allocate 30 billion of these funds to residential construction instead of the so-called defense of our borders. Ladies and gentlemen, of course, the anti-abortion law must be liberalized. Abortion up to the 12th week is simply a human right. But there are also many other reasons why Polish women do not have children. These are housing difficulties, lack of housing, low earnings, problems with combining professional careers, or even professional work, with motherhood. Finally, it is insufficient help from fathers in raising and supporting children, but also the role of the Polish mother model, a mother who is supposed to sacrifice herself for her children, for her husband, to be a kind of martyr. Perhaps changing this model would do a lot, but for me, there is also another reason in the studies. 30% of young women do not want to have children. And 70% of them do not want to have children because they simply do not like children. Thank you very much. A politician has low prestige, while a professor has very high prestige, so perhaps many professors in the Sejm is the solution. Sometimes I had the impression that the Sejm was indeed so poor, especially during the eight years of "Kaczyzm," that if you took 460 MPs and rounded them up on the street, perhaps they would make better laws. But I believe that my path to politics should be a model for everyone. First, you have to show what you can do with your own life, and only then arrange the lives of others, i.e., make laws. When I entered politics, I was 47 years old. I was already a Belvedere professor, dean of the faculty of management, and rector of the first private school in Gdynia. I promoted 600 masters and six doctors. I wrote several books and several hundred articles. I did not enter politics for money or for fame. I wanted to share my skills. Yes, this is a question for Sławomir Mentzen. You portray yourself as a defender of Poland's sovereignty against the European Union. Would you therefore support the denunciation of the Concordat, an international agreement that imposes many obligations on Poland, but gives us nothing in return? Well, it seems you are unaware that the agreement with the Vatican, the Concordat, imposes many obligations on Poland, including financial ones. Among other things, it requires organizing catechism in schools, which children and young people no longer want to attend. It also finances certain universities and many other things, and gives nothing in return, which violates our sovereignty. The postponement of the 20% tariffs was not due to Trump's love for the European Union, but out of fear, simple fear, because the EU decided and announced retaliatory tariffs. And this is exactly how one must deal with politicians like Trump, who only fear strength. Poland will not lose that much from the direct tariff increase, because our trade with the United States is small. However, we will of course lose indirectly, because we both trade on a large scale and cooperate with Germany, which will be more affected by this tariff increase. Well, the European Union has also started talks with India as part of its defense, and this will most likely cause Trump to withdraw these tariffs in the end. Trump ridiculed himself promising to end the Russian-Ukrainian war within one day of his election. Well, the war continues to this day, and of course, it is in the interest not only of Poland, but of the entire democratic world, to end this war as soon as possible on fair terms. That is, we cannot allow Russia to run wild, to gain so much that it concludes that in a few years it might be worth attacking other countries, although Poland is not among them. Trump, unfortunately, conducts a policy that is exclusively in the interest of the USA. He wants access to rare earth metals in Ukraine precisely to – well, if he got it, then probably these negotiations with Russia would be faster. There are many problems to solve here, because, first of all, there has been no policy since 1990, social policy has been completely abandoned, including policy concerning seniors, pensioners, and retirees. Pensioners and retirees are currently one of the poorest social strata, because as many as 400,000 pensioners are starving, literally living below the social minimum. How could this have been solved? Well, among other things, funds from the KPO could have been allocated to various conveniences. But PiS did not do this during its rule, because it completely squandered KPO funds with its erroneous policy. Yes, this is a question for Sławomir Mentzen. You portray yourself as a defender of Poland's sovereignty against the European Union. Would you therefore support the denunciation of the Concordat, an international agreement that imposes many obligations on Poland, but gives us nothing in return? Well, it seems you are unaware that the agreement with the Vatican, the Concordat, imposes many obligations on Poland, including financial ones. Among other things, it requires organizing catechism in schools, which children and young people no longer want to attend. It also finances certain universities and many other things, and gives nothing in return, which violates our sovereignty. A question for Marek Jakubiak, in reference to his legitimate concern for Polish seniors. Many of them are so-called "fourth-floor prisoners." How can this problem be solved to free them and allow them to leave their homes? And now Joanna Seneszyn's rebuttal. Yes, elevators are indeed the best solution, because then seniors who can still walk around their apartment but cannot walk up stairs will be freed. Unfortunately, very often the conservator of monuments does not even agree to install an elevator in buildings that are, well, monuments. My dears, just like you, I want an undivided homeland, where Pole is not a wolf to Pole. Enough of bickering and quarrels. Let's respect each other. Differences are not a reason for hatred, contempt, insults, exclusion, and incitement. Let us be united in diversity and together build a better future for all of us. On May 18th, vote for a Poland where there is no need to fear war or poverty, where the state cares for the legitimate interests of workers, but also of parents raising children. It cares for youth and seniors, for women and all minorities. It helps develop honest businesses, and protects farmers from the competition of unhealthy and cheaper food from imports. Vote for a proven life story, not for a CV that changes depending on the polls. And on Friday, before dusk and the election silence, at 5:00 PM, I invite you for tea with me at Zbawiciela Square in Warsaw, on the eastern side of the Rainbow. Let's fill the square with love and joy. My dears, may the force be with us. We are going to victory.
