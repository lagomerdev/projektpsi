Ladies and gentlemen, the program I offer is popular among Poles because it concerns their daily lives, but that does not mean there are no groups who dislike it. And so, the housing problem is a serious one. I have an offer for those who cannot afford housing today, neither to rent on the private market nor to buy an apartment. This is, of course, a fight to ensure that as much money as possible goes to subsidies for local governments to build rental housing. But I started my campaign with an offer for those who would like to buy such an apartment. This means lowering mortgage interest rates by reducing bank profits on these loans. This can be done with one law. When I proposed this solution, bankers and those who cooperate with them responded. I heard an avalanche of comments that it was impossible to do. But, ladies and gentlemen, I will not be afraid of banks or developers, and I will always stand by your side when it comes to ensuring you have a roof over your head. Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard a heap of nonsense and insults directed at women here. And this is outrageous, because it is obvious to every woman that access to abortion is an important decision at the moment when she decides to become pregnant, because it testifies to how the state treats her and whether she will have access to good medical care, which is best evidenced by the story of Mrs. Anita. But of course, that's not all, because a young woman who decides whether she wants to have a family wonders if she will be able to support it. Will it not be the case that she will first have to slave away at unpaid internships and practices, and then in a precarious labor market, where the State Labor Inspectorate does not have enough money to protect her rights? Will she have a place to live and start a family? Will she be able to afford to pay for a loan or rent on the private market with that money? Finally, many people after their first child decide not to have more, because they know how difficult it is to get into a nursery or how difficult it is to pay for kindergarten. Until we solve these problems, we will not solve the demographic crisis, and no right-winger will do that for you. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for change in politics. I differ from many of my colleagues in that I never mislead, I don't change my mind based on polls, and I take my election promises very seriously, which is why, since the last parliamentary elections, I have been fighting for your interests every day. To introduce widow's pensions, to finally make Christmas Eve a non-working day, to shorten working hours while maintaining the same salary. And during this election campaign, I not only talk about access to abortion, but I also actively fight to protect those brave women who help other women. Whether in Oleśnica, when fanatical supporters of Grzegorz Braun attack them, or in Warsaw, when they have to fight other fanatics, and Rafał Trzaskowski cannot defend them. I talk about labor rights and the fact that they should be respected in Poland, but at the same time I intervene, whether in Gniezno, at the Jeremias factory, or at Tesla near Berlin, where 1000 Poles work, and that is what this different politics is about. About proving to you that I am with you at all times. I have a question for Sławomir Mentzen. You have repeatedly said that beating children is okay. Violence also takes other forms. For example, neglect or not paying child support. I have a question for you: do you also support these forms of violence against children? What is your position on alimony, child support, and the obligation of parents to pay them? You have 20 seconds for your rebuttal now. What is shocking to me is that Mr. Sławomir Mentzen does not understand where I got the idea that he does not prioritize the well-being of children, because like a typical right-winger, he talks a lot about the well-being of children, but when it comes down to specifics, he cannot take care of them. You have repeatedly said that a simple spank has never harmed anyone. When it was necessary, when the well-being of the child should be prioritized, you prioritize above all else. The well-being of violence and force. Very well. Ladies and gentlemen, yes, the European Union is a strong, solidary, and unequivocal strong response to the threat of tariffs from Donald Trump. A precise blow in response to the great technological industry of the United States. Showing that we will not be pushed around, but above all, that we will not be played off against each other. This is a strategy for Donald Trump's policy, for a short-sighted policy, a policy from which he has backed down and will continue to back down, because he knows very well that he simply will not stand up to the competition in a clash with a large market such as the European Union. But the truth is also that we must go further. We must prepare for a new national order, a new international order, and the direction we should go is not only armaments, which are much discussed, but precisely energy transformation, ensuring low energy prices throughout the EU, but especially in Poland, where we are far behind. Also, to ensure that the large enterprises in which we will invest can continue to develop without fear of acquisition. I wonder what kind of promotions Mr. Maciak benefits from in that market, because I'm starting to wonder. Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, yes, the European Union is a strong, solidary, and unambiguous strong response to the threat of tariffs from Donald Trump. A precise blow in response to the great technological industry of the United States. Showing that we will not be pushed around, but above all, that we will not be played off against each other. This is a strategy for Donald Trump's policy, for a short-sighted policy, a policy from which he has backed down and will continue to back down, because he knows very well that he simply will not stand up to the competition in a clash with a large market such as the European Union. But the truth is also that we must go further. We must prepare for a new national order, a new international order, and the direction we should go is not only armaments, which are much discussed, but precisely energy transformation, ensuring low energy prices throughout the EU, but especially in Poland, where we are far behind. Also, to ensure that the large enterprises in which we will invest can continue to develop without fear of acquisition. Yes, that's right. Donald Trump is conducting these negotiations solely in the interest of how he understands the interest of the United States. This is not necessarily synonymous with the actual interest of his country. However, what we should do as Poland and as the European Union is to ensure we have a seat at the negotiating table. And I say "buy" with Russian money. I was the first in this campaign to say that it's time for the European Union to use frozen Russian assets, frozen in European banks, as part of sanctions. And this has finally happened. After pressure from Poland, but also other countries in our region, the first tranche of 2 billion euros has been released, which will be allocated to Ukraine's defense, to support our defense and our stabilization. And this is the path we should follow, using the resources we have, to ensure that this peace is concluded on terms acceptable to Ukraine and funded by the aggressor. Now it's my turn to ask a question to Mr. Karol Nawrocki. Poland has so far supported Ukraine's aspirations for NATO membership. Of course, in the future, when the war ends. Meanwhile, during the last debate, you agreed with Sławomir Mentzen that Ukraine should never join NATO. Do you really stand by that opinion? Mr. Karol, I'll read something to you. "We believe that soon we will meet Ukraine in NATO, and later in the European Union." Do you know who this is? Lech Kaczyński. President Lech Kaczyński, because he knew that Ukraine in NATO would support Poland, that Ukraine in NATO is a condition of our security. And you are playing games and aligning yourself today with Russian agents like Mr. Braun and Mr. Maciak. Aren't you simply ashamed? This is an expression of my independence, Madam Marshal. Meanwhile, please. Poland is the 21st largest economy in the world, and it's high time that after years of transformation, those who worked hard for this prosperity could benefit from it. There's really no reason for us to keep waiting indefinitely for shorter working hours, for effective healthcare, for access to housing, because if we only talk like this, we will wait further. Yes, of course, I will sign the bill on the tax on excess profits, but that law will not be enough to lower the cost of credit, because it affects the fact that these excess profits, which were enormous, 40 billion zlotys last year, will partly go back to the state budget and, for example, finance the housing fund, for the construction of rental housing, but there is still a lack of order with mortgage loans. In Poland, the average new mortgage loan costs over 7%. It is burdened with a huge margin and surcharges. In the old EU, it's not even 4%. It's time for us to finally bravely deal with this. And regarding school, yes, our school needs more support in protecting children from digital threats. I believe that the path leads primarily through education and training for children, adults, and teachers. In my school, we jointly introduced a ban on phones in schools, in our school. We are very happy about this, because children spend time together during breaks. I encourage everyone to do this, but first, everyone must understand where this threat comes from and why we must counteract it. Of course, we could address it together, provided that you stop telling fairy tales about how lowering healthcare spending will increase competitiveness in healthcare and improve the quality of medical services, because this is one of the urgent crises we must address. A crisis affecting both adults and young people. A crisis resulting from the devastating collapse of psychiatry, especially child and adolescent psychiatry, which has been ongoing for years. It is the result of years of neglect. But we will do nothing until we increase funding for healthcare. And if you join the chorus of those who, like Mr. Szymon Hołownia, invent new tax breaks, new holes in this budget, in order to give gifts just before elections to one small group of entrepreneurs, without thinking about the consequences, for all of us, for the families of these entrepreneurs, for your family, for all these children we are all so worried about, we will not get far. So first and foremost, actions, not words. Ladies and gentlemen, when I travel around Poland, you tell me very clearly that these elections are important to you, that you want your voice to matter. And I have important news for you. You can use your voice this Sunday to set the direction Poland should take. A vote for me is a clear signal that you no longer want half-measures, that you are tired of the same old promises made by the center-right, that you will no longer forget that it is finally time to introduce accessible housing, legal abortion, civil partnerships, well-functioning healthcare, reduced working hours, and that these changes simply must be implemented here and now, in this term. A vote for me is a vote for a new generation of the left, one that from street protests through workers' strikes to parliament and government always stands by your side and is not afraid to fight for your rights. It is a vote for a leader who is not here to eternally shout the same lofty slogans, but who rolls up her sleeves and is now, even in a difficult coalition, fighting for their implementation every day and who is not afraid to fight this fight to snatch solutions to your problems right here and now, because your life will not wait. A vote for me is support for solving, for a politics that is about solving your problems. If you want it to continue, if you want us to have a mandate, a mandate to achieve even more in this government, then on May 18th, go to the polls, vote for a new quality of politics, vote for me. Of course, we could deal with it together, on condition that you stop telling fairy tales about how lowering healthcare spending will increase competitiveness in healthcare and improve the quality of medical services, because this is one of the urgent crises we must deal with.
