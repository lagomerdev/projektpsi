I will not implement anything against the sovereign. I will always be the sovereign. That is why I advocate for direct democracy. Direct democracy that will allow all of us to make decisions. It is together in referendums that we will decide what is most important to us. It is together in threshold-free referendums, in referendums that will be binding for those in power, that we will decide what kind of Poland we want. It is together that we will decide on all social, economic, and political solutions. We will not have to listen to politicians who promise us everything but deliver nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, it is together that we will reduce the Council of Ministers to 33 people, not 140, 33 including the Prime Minister. It is together that we will ensure that state budget subsidies for political parties disappear. It is together that we will prohibit families and members of political parties from working in state-owned companies. Ladies and gentlemen, once again you see how society is divided. Just say abortion and immediately there are pros and cons, all those who want to continue leading to Poles trembling, Poles being uncertain, Poles losing certainty about tomorrow, not knowing what to do. Let's stop this. Let's implement direct democracy. Let's decide once and for all. Polish women do not make abortion the goal of their lives. Polish women want security, they want family, they want beauty, they want joy, they want success in their work, they want development. Just as every person dreams that tomorrow will be better. Let's stop intimidating ourselves with phenomena, processes that only divide us, break us apart, atomize us. Ladies and gentlemen, I will implement a grand demographic program so that in 15 years there will be 46 million of us, and by the end of the century 80 million, because a strong Poland requires demographics. Ladies and gentlemen, politicians have the lowest support, and firefighters have the highest. Why? Because firefighters help. Politicians harm. Ladies and gentlemen, Article Four of the Constitution states: "The supreme power in the Republic of Poland belongs to the Nation. The Nation shall exercise its power through its representatives or directly." If your representative, your proxy, does not deliver, does not give you results, what should you do? You should recall him. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we will introduce a simple principle within direct democracy: the citizens' veto. We will give them rights, but we will also recall them. If they do not implement what we want, what is important to us. This, ladies and gentlemen, will be the most important thing in the direct democracy process. Together we will implement change. These are not individual characteristics. This is the strength and power of the nation. Mr. Krzysztof, if you allow me, I will take this opportunity and free the flag of the Republic of Poland from this circus. I will twist it. You must take it. I can't just. You see, ladies and gentlemen, the flag is safe now. And now, Mr. Szymon, if you could just move a little to the left, because Mr. Rafał's ego, what he didn't do in Warsaw, is outstanding. You, you and your supporters, Mr. Szymon, declaratively stand in defense of the Republic of Poland's Constitution. Please tell me, how do you assess the activities of public television and public radio in the context of ensuring equal presentation of all candidates in these elections? What do you know about this? Marshal, Artur Bartoszewicz reports. Public media is a propaganda tool of Mr. Rafał Trzaskowski, who accepts this pathology in their operation. Mr. Sygód, Mr. Gorgosz, these are former employees of Mr. Rafał. You ensured that I was completely isolated from public media during the presidential campaign. I did not exist. Ladies and gentlemen, you heard helplessness, the helplessness of politicians who are either terrified or claim that the European Union should handle the matter for us. No, ladies and gentlemen, economic policy is conducted within two elements: fiscal policy and monetary policy. You see, the latter, monetary policy, is not mentioned in the debate. Fiscal policy, that is precisely where mechanisms related to customs duties are an element. But if something is not working in this area, beautiful actions can be taken by having your own independent monetary policy. But for that to happen, you need an independent central bank, not one that is undermined and destroyed, and you need your own currency, the Polish zloty. I will not agree to abandon the Polish zloty, because the Polish zloty will provide us with protection against customs duties today, it will give us the opportunity to earn money and make a great deal. And Germany, excuse me, I am not interested in the situation in Germany at all. Ladies and gentlemen, fairy tales, fairy tales, fairy tales, because if someone doesn't understand economics, they have no idea what they are talking about. Ladies and gentlemen, the report "Predatory Green Deal." Here you will find information on how the European Union treats us, how we are treated, how we perceive the European Union. Poles want to be in the European Union. 63% of Poles say: "Yes, we are for the European Union." But 62.5% say: "The European Union means strong national states within the Union." Fairy tales about Germany being weak, France being weak. Really, listen, ladies and gentlemen, in a moment we will see that Poland has suddenly grown in their eyes. Nonsense. Ladies and gentlemen, in Paris there has been a school of economic warfare for 25 years, because economic warfare in the European Union is an everyday reality. Only those who spoke a moment ago are unaware of what we are participating in. Ladies and gentlemen, 200 agents trained to be agents of influence and to influence in the interest of France. We need global entrepreneurs to face them. And give wealth to Poles. Ladies and gentlemen, at our border for years we have had and still have to deal with a proxy war. Two hegemons, Russia and the United States, are fighting on Ukrainian territory. Today, the United States wants to end this process. We must find ourselves in this space, because unfortunately, the greater costs of the war have been shifted to the Republic of Poland, to us, to citizens, to our economy, to our society. We transferred weapons and military equipment. We financed the Ukrainian army. We are causing us to suffer as an economy and society through our decisions, because the neighboring nation benefits. We must end this process. We must settle all transactions that were carried out. We must also ensure that money flowing in for aid will not return here as investment funds and the takeover of Polish entrepreneurs. We must take care of our own interest, the interest of the Republic of Poland, sit down at the negotiations, and win against the United States. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, regardless of how the European Green Deal is re-narrated, the matter is simple. According to Professor Ryszard Piotrowski's analysis, both the concept of the European Green Deal and the solutions serving its implementation violate the constitution. Articles 1, 2, 5, 20, 21, 30, 317, 76, and 90. This is true. Time for a rebuttal. A wise politician defends society, especially young people, from alcohol degradation. You don't defend, you prey on young people. By law, beer advertising cannot be directed at minors. It cannot be shown to them. It cannot associate alcohol consumption with physical fitness or driving. It cannot evoke associations with sexual attractiveness, relaxation or rest, study or work. And it is completely the opposite. He's clearly not responsible for that anymore. I will say that the senator is very charming in her theses. However, I would like to say that, ladies and gentlemen, there was talk of a duopoly of power just now. If a third party comes to power, there will be another duopoly. That changes nothing. Today, the phrase "direct democracy" has been used several times here. Referendums, the nation taking responsibility for the state. A question to you [unclear who] is not directed at anyone. We know who the question is for. Please listen, don't speak. Artur, please, tell me what you think about direct democracy. Ladies and gentlemen, without direct democracy, we are unable to stabilize the state. We are unable to break this duopoly. We are unable to bring about a situation in which the mutual destruction of the two largest parties, PiS and Civic Platform, which are in fact one party with two factions, is also destroying our society. If we do not separate these two parties, if we do not stabilize our own security, this is only possible through direct democracy, there will be no security for you, your children, no security for your parents, your fathers, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers. Listen, ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge challenge. It requires only courage. Article four of the constitution unequivocally states that we can do this directly. We need threshold-free, binding referendums. We absolutely need a citizens' veto, so that we can not only appoint them, but so that we can recall all of them standing here, because they are not delivering results. Yes, ladies and gentlemen. He who appoints, recalls. The citizen, and this is a request to you. You must take responsibility for your own state. If you do not take responsibility for your own state, politicians will take that responsibility for you. Pretending that everything is fine leads us to nothingness. Direct democracy. What Kukiz '15 has been saying from the beginning makes sense. And please listen, because that sound means time is up. Time for the next question. Artur Bartoszewicz asks it. A question for Dr. Karol Nawrocki. You declaratively oppose, excuse me, the European Green Deal. The culture and heritage of Silesia is mining. The tradition of this region allows, ladies and gentlemen, to build its strength and developmental power. What is the current output in the mines? Centrum Kazimierz Juliusz, Murcki, Makoszowy, Krupiński, Wieczorek, Śląsk, Piekary. What do you know about this, doctor? In all these mines, production is zero. Silesia without mining loses its identity. People lose their jobs. Their heritage is being liquidated. Under the Civic Platform government, KWK Centrum Kazimierz Juliusz Murcki was liquidated. Under the PiS government, KWK Makoszowy, Krupiński, Wieczorek, Śląsk, Piekary were liquidated. Ladies and gentlemen, under AWS, 17 coal mines were liquidated, and the mining disaster started with AWS. Now there is such a question. Fellow citizens, before you stands a citizen. A citizen who is ready to become the head of state. Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard slogans and indeed empty words repeated by so-called puppet candidates. Party promises, lies, hypocrisy are the essence of their programs. Puppets put forward by the heads of PO and PiS, people with the mentality of swindlers. They have already cheated firefighters, farmers, transporters, nurses, midwives, border guards, military personnel. They have cheated francophone loan holders and those harmed by Amber Gold, Getback, or Skok Wołomin. They have cheated all of us in the FOS scandal. They have cheated pensioners, retirees, and people with disabilities. Election polls, ladies and gentlemen, are lies and manipulation. During the campaign. The media ignored me throughout and are now attacking and destroying my person and my good name. As the only candidate, I have prepared a full socio-economic program, which I have posted on the website 777.org.pl. During all the debates, you got to know me. You also got to know my son. You will meet the candidate for First Lady in the second round. She is a phenomenal woman with a strong and courageous mind, immense academic and professional achievements. A lady that Poland and Poles are waiting for. Together we will perform a distinguished function and bring pride and dignity to Poles. Be brave, for you are intelligent. Vote for Artur Bartoszewicz.
